# thefrontend

'Thefrontend' is a new web project I'm starting. I hope to make it in to a rails driven community site for frontend web developers in the UK. As a frontender myself I've perceived a lack of representation of my chosen profession online in the UK aswell as well as no centralized place for things such as front end vacancies, discussion boards or blog posts.

As I'll be developing the site entirely in my spare time it is likley that the launch date might be someway off as it will also be a learning experience for me, however to show my commitment to the cause I have registered a shiny new TLD: thefrontend.co

Wish me luck!
