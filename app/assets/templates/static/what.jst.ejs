<p>'Thefrontend' is a new web project I'm we're starting. I hope to make it in to a rails driven community site for frontend web developers in the UK. As a frontender myself I've perceived a lack of representation of my chosen profession online in the UK aswell as well as no centralized place for things such as front end vacancies, discussion boards or blog posts.</p>

<p>As I'll be developing the site entirely in my spare time it is likley that the launch date might be someway off as it will also be a learning experience for me, however to show my commitment to the cause I have registered a shiny new TLD: thefrontend.co</p>
